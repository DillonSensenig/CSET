##The tools and techniques for web development have changed a lot over the years.
How will you personally try to keep up with those changes and where can you look to find them?

Personally I will use MDN as well as other resources like Youtube, W3School and other websites. Everything that i could posibly need to learn about web development can be found online.


##The lecture and readings discussed the limitations of using floats for layout. What are some of these limitations? Provide an example.

Using floats for the entire layout of a website can cause some problems such as when expanding a page it can push and pull the floats in odd ways making the 
page not look like what you want it to look like. 


##Flexbox is built to be language agnostic, so it uses generic terminology like the "Main" or "Cross" axis.
Choose a flex property that affects one of these axes on a flex container and explain how it is used.
Show how the result can change based on different flex directions and different writing modes.

Using flex-direction changes the direction of the content selected. So, if you have 3 flex boxes next to eachother and use "row" it will change it from whatever it was to 
a row. If you use "column" it will place them on top of one another. Both column and row have "reverse" versions where it reverses the boxes, and places them in the opposite
side of the screen.
