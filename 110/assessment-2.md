Pick your favorite CSS property so far. Explain what it's used for and all the potential values or units it can take. Why do you like it?

My favorite CSS property is Position simply because it makes everything so much easier to place on the page. It's simple left, right, top, bottom, center etc. 

Imagine you are making a website for a restaurant and you need to style the menu options to show that some are spicy or vegetarian or gluten-free. If all the menu options are using the same HTML elements, what CSS selector(s) could you use and why? Show an example.

<p class="spicy"> or "gluf" 
.spicy { 
color: red;
font-style: bold;
}

.gluf {
color: green;
font-style: italic;

Style rules sometimes conflict with each other, especially in large projects. Explain the difference between cascade, inheritance, and specificity and how you can use these concepts to organize your CSS.
You can use these styles to organize your projects by assigning a name to a specific line or an entire group then call on the name using the #ID or Class selector to apply whatever you want to it
