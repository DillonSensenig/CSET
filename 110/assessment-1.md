**Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?**

- HTML being an open standard controlled by a specification is much better compared to a company because that company would have full control over what everything does, they would be
able to charge for usage of HTML.

**Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.**

- The difference between what an element is versus a tag is elements are what a starting and ending tag represent together. This is an Element: <p>   </p>
This element allows HTML to recognize that what's inside of them is a paragraph.
- Tags are what's inside of the <> brackets and what they represent 
Ex: <br> - br stands for a page break

**In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.**

- Yoda's quote put into perspective that syntax can be perceieved differently by other people or programs. So when we use syntax it can be confusing because its a different language
sometimes our syntax may not make much sense in our native language, although the computer will recognize what you are trying to explain to it.
- The quote from Naom Chomsky was interesting because it meant nothing, but it was correctly written. Comparing that to HTML semantics -- something like <hr/> which has absolutely no meaning
It has no real value to us besides creating a thin line. Unlike something like <p></p> a paragraph element that lets HTML recognize what's inside of it as a paragraph.
