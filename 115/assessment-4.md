## This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews?
Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes?

Overall i'd say I could answer SOME of these types of questions during an interview. I'm comfortable with explaining how some things work and what I think about 
something, but if there is a question about complicated JS or terminal usage I would have a tough time answering.


## In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling.
Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important.

Linters for sure. I tend to have a lot of errors with my code concerning syntax and uncecessary code. Especially useful if I ever work for a company that may have an eslint
configured to tell me where in my code the error is and what the error is about.


## Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example.

Stages for the waterfall methodoligy are called "phases" whereas the "agile" methodologies stages are called a "sprint".
The agile methodology focuses on "adaptability and flexibility" whereas in the waterfall method "price and scheduling" are more important.
