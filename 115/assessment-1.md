Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?

Working on projects like our resume's were really fun to mess around with what we initally learned in the start of the HTML/CSS section. I think that working in the "professional" world 
will be very interesting. I'm sure it wouldnt be nearly as fun unless you are working for yourself or for a company that has similar ideas as you. I'm scared to work in the professional world
because i'm not the greatest at communication, but I'm twenty times better than I was during high school, and i'm only improving more as we go.

Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter,
walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.

Well, first I could create an "event" so I can bind the options automatically to certain keys on the user's keyboard. 1 2 3 A B C whatever. So that when they select "jump" [1] It will 
continue without the user having to use their mouse. (thought that was a cool) Then once one of the options are selected it will the getelementbyid "jump" dialogue its connected to and display it.

Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?

Different data structures are useful because there are many that tailor to different forms of code other than HTML.
The DOM uses a tree because trees are easy to navigate through, and HTML's structure is similar to a tree. 
It probably could work as a structure other than a tree, but it would be much harder to navigate through.
