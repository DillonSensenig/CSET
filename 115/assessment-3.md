## What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?

I think that the most difficult aspect of working on a project in a larger teamn will be planning who does what. Not everyone can work on one part of the project at a time. 
Splitting the work depending on who does what best or has most experience in that specific field or subject then splitting each person/s into groups to complete specific projects.
I feel like some people won't be happy with what they have to work on.

## Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.

Branches start at the Master branch in most cases or the "origin." Branches can be committed, and after committing the focus will move from the previous branch to the new branch that
you created.
A remote is a public repository stored on a server that isnt your own. Multiple people can share their code from a remote location.

## For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?

Using the gitflow workflow almost because looking back at someones code, editing it, then submitting it back to the master.
