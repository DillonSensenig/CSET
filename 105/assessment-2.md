= After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?

- For the time being, being able to understand what every single term is off the top of my head will be the hardest challenge. I've taken time to create categories with 
each type of term and have written what they are, what they mean and created a list of all the terms in that category that I know of. To overcome this challenge further
I will do more testing outside of class time so I can understand what each of them do while they are in action.

= Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.

- For loops are used to load in the starting value. Whatever we "initialize" into that loop will run first, before the actual loop starts.
- While loops run for a minimum of zero times, because the condition inside of it has to run and have an outcome of true or false before it can run. If false the loop wont run.
- A "do while" loop tests the condition at the end of the loop so they run a minimum of 1 time. 

= We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?

- Having learned how to split problem solving into two parts will help in future classes, because writing the pseudocode first let's you understand in ENGLISH what you are trying
have then written into code. Being able to describe clear, concise ideas before you actually convert it into code makes it easier for you and anyone you are working with to collaborate
on code because you will both understand the base idea layed out.
