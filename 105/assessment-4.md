##  After completing the first course, how would you rate yourself? Is there anything you want to do differently to start the next course? 

- I would rate myself at a 6/10 on this first course. Obviously my participation has been lacking and asking questions after the first two weeks has dwindled to me asking
almost nothing. I want to start using the resources provided to me more frequently and participate more inside of my group.
-- wasnt sure how to answer #2
##  Now explain why the author chose to use one structure over the other for each example you chose. Follow the same reasoning and explain how you could have used objects and arrays in your adventure game from last week. 

-  Using objects during our game would have let us easily pull them out using dot notation.  Using array's would have allowed us to store multiple values in a single variable. It would shorten code and simplify it while also letting us pull out one or a multiple of those values at once.
An example of how we could use that is storing an array of weapons, assigning them each an attribute then pulling them out.
