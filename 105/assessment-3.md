### How do you feel about the pace of the program so far? Is it too slow? Too fast? Or just right?
*I feel like the pace of the program so far has been a little too fast for me.*

### Why do you think functions are a useful tool to organize large programs?
Functions are a useful tool to have in large programs because the data that your able to store inside functions can greatly minimize the amount of work you need to do
to complete whatever task you are trying to complete.

### In class, we've been using the analogy of a zoo to explain scope. Describe the different types of scope using this analogy and provide examples using real JavaScript code.
There are a few scopes such as the Global Scope, Local Scope and the Nested Scope. Each of these scopes can look at the scopes surrounding them. But, when theres a binding outside of
a scope with the same name as one inside the scope. The one closest to the begginning of the code will be the one that gets recognized. Functions can be put inside of functions and so
on. 

Global Scope: A binding that isnt inside a function
Local Scope: A binding that lays within the function box
Nested Scope: The book mentions nested scope somewhere and It just sounded similar to how local scopes can see the other local scope around it or something?
